# renormnu
 Compute renormalized angular momentum

* This package uses functions from the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit.
* Currently, this requires high precision routines.
* We use `mpmath` to do the high precision computations.
* All high precision functions to compute nu are included in this package.
* At some point we may include the nu computation used in `GremlinEq` which could be done completely in numpy/scipy.
